/**
 * SplitQueueList — a linked two-list "processing queue" sidebar.
 *
 * One sidebar, two stacked lists sharing a fixed height. The TOP list holds
 * *resolved* (processed) items; the BOTTOM list holds *unresolved* (to-process)
 * items. The user works the bottom; resolving an item appends it to the BOTTOM
 * of the top list (at the seam between the two), so the most-recent work sits
 * adjacent to what's next and is one click away to revisit.
 *
 * Sizing (see ./layout.ts for the testable core; the component measures the
 * real header/row heights and re-measures on container resize via ResizeObserver):
 *  - The TOP list is content-driven between a 1-row floor and a 3-row cap: 0
 *    categorized still shows 1 row of space; 1/2/3 grow to fit; 4+ caps at 3 and
 *    the pane scrolls so the NEWEST row sits flush at the seam (newest-at-seam).
 *  - The BOTTOM list gets the remaining space and scrolls when overfull.
 *  - The cap holds only while the bottom has enough content to fill its area;
 *    when the bottom is short it shrinks to its content and the freed slack flows
 *    UP, so the top may grow past 3 rows.
 *  - When the bottom is empty, it collapses to a thin "all clear" strip.
 *
 * Animation (SUI owns it — the consumer just swaps the two arrays):
 *  When a key leaves `unresolved` and appears in `resolved`, the component
 *  FLIP-animates it from its old spot up across the seam to the bottom of the
 *  resolved list. During the slide it paints TWO clipped copies — one styled
 *  as unresolved (clipped by the bottom list's top edge) and one styled as
 *  resolved (emerging from the top list's bottom edge) — so the row visually
 *  *repaints* as it crosses the seam. Honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.
 *
 * Generic over the item type `T`; pass `keyOf` for identity and `renderItem`
 * for content.
